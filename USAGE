N.B. First make sure that smidgen has been built before working through 
these instructions.

Smidgen uses the sip class description files as used by PyQt. Until I have documented
the subset of sip that is available in smidgen then it is best to take a look at the 
morseld/sip directory to see how a C++ library is wrapped with smidgen. Note:

There is one top-level sip file, in this case morsel.sip. Inside this file there is
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Registration of C++ <=> D converter specs (Optional)

* The GetClassNameC code that returns the name of the C++ class for a given
  wrapped C++ instance (Essential IF you have wrapped classes that form a
  type hierarchy)

* A list of %Include declarations to sip files each of which are a sip package/module.
  It is suggested that you start with only one package until smidgen is a little
  more mature.

In each sip file for a package (e.g. morselcode_mod.sip) there is
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* The name of the module/package

* Any primitive C++ <=> D typedef equivalences that are not default for the platform

* A list of %Includes, one for each C++ class/struct to be wrapped

In each class sip file, e.g. rect.sip
-------------------------------------

* A sip style class wrapper definition, very similar to a .h file

* With the class definition a %TypeHeaderCode section that gives C++ code
  that will be needed to compile the C++ wrapper for this class, usually 
  a header include.

* A list of member functions as found in a header file. It is not necessary
  to include all members etc., simply include the functions that you want to wrap.

RUNNING SMIDGEN TO GENERATE THE WRAPPER CLASSES (D and C++)
===========================================================
For instance, to create the wrappers for morsel we do:

$ smidgen /path/to/morsel.sip path/to/build

where build is an empty subdirecctory where the cpp and d wrappers will be generated.

COMPILING THE WRAPPER CLASSES AND D APPLICATION
===============================================
Take a look at the CMakeLists.txt files in morseld/build/cpp/morselcore and morseld/build/cpp/morselwidget/
to see how to use cmake to compile the generated C++ wrappers into a shared library.

Take a look at the CMakeLists.txt file in morseld/test and see how use_morsel.d is compiled
using dmd and the shared C++ library generated from the C++ wrappers.

USING THE WRAPPED CLASSES
=========================

Take a look at morseld/test/use_morsel.d to see how to use the wrapped classes in
your application code.

SUGGESTION
==========
Don't try to declare everything to be wrapped at once. Start with one package
and one class with a few member functions. Once you have that working,
add more classes and member functions. Pay attention to the sip file 'grammar'
and follow it closely.

QUESTIONS
=========
I haven't started work on the documentation, so please post any questions
on the forums and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.
