Currently smidgen builds on the linux 64bit platform, with dmd 2.064.

First, from the smidgen directory, run cmake to generate the make file:

$ cmake .

Then run make install:

$ make install

The build system needs a bit of help at this point so add the built libraries to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./install/libs

then run the tests:

$ make test

Assuming the tests pass then you're ready to use smidgen to wrap your own C++ library. See the USAGE file for more information.

If the tests fail then do

$ cat Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log

from the smidgen directory to see a log. Post it to the forum if the problem is not clear to you.
