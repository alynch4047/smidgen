Currently smidgen builds on the linux 64bit platform, with dmd 2.064.

First run cmake to generate the make file:

$ cmake .

Then run make install:

$ make install

The build system needs a bit of help at this point so add the built libraries to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./install/libs

then run the tests:

make test

Assuming the tests pass then you're ready to use smidgen to wrap your own C++ library. See the USAGE file for more information.
