FEATURES
========

* All D
* Understandable, maintainable code
* Wraps protected and virtual methods, allows virtual methods to be overridden in D 
* Mixin classes in target C++ library supported
* Allows custom type conversions between C++ and D types
* C++ enums mapped to D enums and are type checked in D
* Wraps nested C++ classes
* Tested
* Based on the sip format. This is well proven and allows simplified maintenance of
  wrappers for multiple versions of the target library.  (All larger target libraries will
  need some ongoing maintenance of the wrapper regardless of the wrapping technology).


PROVISOS
========

* Currently works with wrapped method arguments/return types of X, X* and X& 
  but not implemented are X*& etc.
  
* Wrapped types which are returned by value must have a copy constructor (could be changed later)
  
* DO NOT capture references to (stack-based) arguments when overriding wrapped 
  virtual methods. They are destroyed by the wrapper when the virtual method ends.
  
* (Qt only) When emitting signals, must use emit! notation, not just call signal.  
  
 GOTCHAS
 =======
 * An invalid getClassNameC can cause segfaults when compiling the target application because
   it is used in template instantiation
   
 * If getClassName does not work for a subclass (QMoveEvent) when we are expecting T = the base class (QEvent),
   and it was created as the base class (QEvent) (because getClassName did not work) then it casts
   to the sub class (QMOveEvent) on a later lookup (because it is defined on the
   other method as the return type) and crashes.
